The goal of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.

Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead.
To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. 
Luckily, here are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:

A dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps).
A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).
